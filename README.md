# Covid19-Mask-Detctor-
This is just a small step towards automating the entire process of checking people before allowing them entry to malls, restaurants, places of worship etc.  
I built this detector specifically to work on devices with limited computational resources and power so that more and more people can actually use this detector and leverage the power of AI.  This project can detector further be enhanced by integrating a wireless temperature sensor like MLX90614, henceforth detecting mask and temperature at the same time.
Special thanks to Adrian Rosenbrock and Andrew Ng for those awesome tutorials that made this thing possible.
